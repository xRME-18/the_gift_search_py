    "description": "The Cardinals on Dogwood design is a beautifully curated piece of metal garden art designed with nature in mind. It is handpainted by our artists to accentuate the iconic bright red color of the cardinal, as well as the beautiful pastel yellow and white hues of a dogwood bloom in springtime.The Cardinals on Dogwood tabbed metal garden art is made of recycled steel and pre-treated to create our signature rusted texture and vintage look. Display it in your garden and you might just spot a real cardinal perched near your garden art!The Northern Cardinal resides in the eastern United States, Canada, and Mexico. This stunning bird is known for its bright red color, although females have brown feathers, as shown through the rusty details in this design. If you\u2019re a Virginian, Cardinals on Dogwood is an excellent choice for your garden, as the dogwood is the state flower of Virginia, and the cardinal is the state bird.Dimensions: 10\" x 11\".",

    "description": "Contact me for custom ORDERSthis amazing traditional Moroccan table was handcrafted by A professional worker, it represents the cultural diversity of Moroccan handcrafts and that is because of its design, material and the colors used at the surface of the table. by obtaining such objects you would be helping a dying craft to flourish again so that contact between the past and the present would never die not mentioning the happiness it would bring to poor workers on fields like this .\" Clay\" this material that is found only in Fes City. In a specific place called \" Ben Jellik\". To get started to bring the clay to this place, and we leave it for 20 days in order for it to dry. When it is dry we use a large hummer to break it into small pieces then we leave it to dry again for whole day before we put it in water for two days. Then there are people who work on cleaning the clay from unwanted rocks and any other material to give to another person. This type of activity is only found in Fes city because it has a close relation go the sun.Other workers are in charge for shaping the clay dough into flower vases, jars, plates .... all of these products are handmade. It is an inherited craft work.After we place the handmade products into the oven for 8 hours with 2000\u00b0C. The next step is painting the products with colours of the fortunes, dinning tables and the walls.We paint the products with natural based colours that are taken from natural resources. The paint brushes used are made from horses hair. They use different colours such as blue, red, black...When they finish they coat them with a material that makes the products shiny so they can put it back into the oven fir 8 hours to bake on burned woods then the products can be used for our daily use. You can use cold or hot water in them, the paint is long lasting.Moving to Zellige, when it bakes for the first time, and the second time with the paint it is given to Nekkach that decides what kind of pattern will be used on it depends on where Zellige will be put. He spreads them flipped in a geometrical pattern based on ancient references such as Karaouiyn, and the king's palaces...Then we use a material called \" La resin \" or \" cola sima\" and we let them dry. After that we flip them to the front to see the design of the Zellige. That is the workmanship of Clay in the City of Fes.Thank youVisit here for more beautiful MOSAIC goods :https://www.etsy.com/shop/CUSTOmosaicKeywords : coffee table interior design home decor furniture coffee coffee time table interior side table design mosaic working coffee shop coffee lover living room dining table coffee holic furniture design decor coffee lovers living room decor coffee addict mosaic coffee art home coffee house coffee table decorpatio furniture outdoor furniture outdoor living patio decor patio patio design garden furniture furniture outdoor decor outdoor design home decor interior design outdoor living space design garden outdoor patio life furniture design backyard design patio style exterior design outdoor dining backyard summer patio living outdoors garden design modern furniture interiorpatios patio dining home decor ideas outdoor chair architecture teak furniture backyard oasis teak home rattan porch decor bahbel patio time luxury furniture porch life landscape design backyard life backyard party outdoor space back porch backyard bliss rattan furniture decor patio garden my backyard decor patio goals backyard goalsoutdoor furniture outdoor living furniture interior design garden furniture design outdoor design furniture design outdoor outdoor decor patio furniture home decor garden patio architecture interior exterior design outdoors luxury furniture patio decor garden design outdoor dining outdoor living space home design decor modern furniture custom furniture",

    "description": "Need a break from the hustle and bustle? Step into your garden and onto your new cosy wooden bench - your new favourite chill spot awaits! Handmade in our workshop in Brighton, East Sussex, this bench is made with solid steel legs and weather resistant finish and it's built to withstand the test of time.Whether you're relaxing or admiring your garden, this bench provides the ideal seating solution. It features high-quality FSC certified reclaimed wood, giving it a charming rustic industrial design with a mix of wood and steel. The weatherproof powder-coated steel legs ensure exceptional durability and weather resistance, while also making assembly a breeze. Plus, when winter rolls around, you can easily disassemble it and store it flat packed.--------------------------------------Details:If you can't find the exact size or finish you're looking for, feel free to reach out for customisation options. Each bench is made to order, ensuring it fits your needs perfectly. The legs measure 40cm tall, while the seat is 38cm deep.--------------------------------------Wood Characteristics:Wood is a living material, characterised by knots, variations in grain, and colour differences. Despite proper drying techniques, wood will naturally expand and contract with changes in humidity. Our benches are crafted and finished with care to accommodate this natural movement. Imperfections such as small cracks, knots, and variations in wood grain are to be expected, particularly in reclaimed wood. These characteristics add to the charm and uniqueness of each bench, without compromising its functionality or structural integrity.Shipping--------------------------------------Important Details:Your garden bench will be delivered flat packed to eliminate the risk of damage during transit. A simple assembly will be required to install the legs. Screws will be provided! You will need a short screwdriver.Buyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply. Pastos Co cannot control any delays due to customs. Contact us if you would like to have more information on import duties & customs.Find us on Instagram and Facebook - @pastos.co",

      "I bought this for a retirement gift. I wanted to get it engraved but the shipping was going to take to long if I got it engraved. So I decide to purchase it and do the engraving myself. I told the seller my intentions, so they shipped the swing first so that I could get a early start on the engraving and shipped the rest later. Thank you for th great customer service. The swing was great also and on time. The one thing that can be better is to have the correct length of screws for the assembly. The ones provided stuck out the back side almost half an inch. I had to replace them with shorter screws. The person that it was given to absolutely loved it. I would purchase again.",
      "I cannot recommend this shop more highly. When I ordered, I was looking for a different color and was willing to stain it myself, they immediately adjusted. Also, the assembly instructions were quite good and they clearly care about assembly, I had questions because I am a goof and within a half hour answered\u2026 thank you!\n\nGreat product and wonderful folks.",
      "Item came in 3 packages. The instructions were clear and the assembly was very easy to",

Each column is welded by hand and pre-rusted so it will blend in with your landscape as soon as you place it in your space. They work great as a stand-alone monolith or combine 2 or more for extra texture. They even make great platforms for climbing vines or vegetable gardening where you have a plant that needs something to grow on like tomatoes or beans.DIMENSIONS24\" T x 5.75\" W x 5.75\" D36\" T x 8.25\" W x 8.25\" D48\" T x 11\" W x 11\" DIf you want a lid to your Garden Column:https://www.etsy.com/listing/1521161735/garden-column-lid-succulent-planter-box?click_key=033619dc41177fff88fd543c6b4e41b0a59aea5a%3A1521161735&click_sum=23261f22&ga_search_query=lid&ref=shop_items_search_1&pro=1&frs=1&sts=1***Please keep in mind that the Rusted finish will vary.

    "description": "Listing is for ONE Live rare succulent plant, Rare Succulents - Caralluma Socotrana, hand picked from our California based greenhouse nursery, listing picture taken under nature light in a 6\" pot.We will randomly select all plants for shipping, ensuring that their size and condition closely match the listing photos. Thank you.Caralluma Socotrana is a distinctive succulent native to Yemen's Socotra Island. Its upright, columnar stems have pronounced vertical ridges and are gray-green. This drought-tolerant plant features small, dark red star-shaped flowers and has both culinary and traditional medicinal uses. As a unique and hardy succulent, it's sought after by collectors and adds a striking touch to arid gardens and succulent collections.About,We are an exotic plant shop based in Los Angeles, California. As a California registered Nursery, it\u2019s our mission to guarantee plants from our shop are healthy and insect/pest free, shipping directly from our greenhouse to your doorShipping,Please allow us up to 3 business days to prepare your order. All plants will be in quarantine before shipping and will be packaged under great care. If you have any special instructions or need the package to leave our nursery at any specific date, please add a note in your order during check out. Soils and pots are not included, to prevent any damage or rotten issues.Tips:Once you receive your purchase, we recommend planting the succulents in soil immediately. Due to shipping, the plants may appear dry, soft, or lighter/darker in color compared to the photos in the online pictures.Soil,Place your plants in porous, well-draining soil. To create an adequate cactus mix, simply combine pumice, perlite, or grit to cactus soil to provide the proper drainage. Succulents require little watering and never like to sit in wet soil. We normally suggest our customer to use 1:1 ratio (1 part amendment like pumice, perlite, lava etc., 1 part cactus/succulent soil) soil mix to start with.Sunlight,Introduce sunlight to your new plants gradually. Do not put your succulents in direct sunlight, but instead try to increase the sun exposure gradually in your home or outside. Leaving your new plants in direct sun will lead to sunburns. We normally suggest our customer to have 40% shade fabric in the area that has intense sunlight.Watering,Succulent: water when soil is dry dry, do not let the plant sit on wet soil overnight.Cactus: NO water until plant rooted, and No water in winter or dormant season.Support,Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns, we are here to help.",

A fountain where every detail counts. Distinguished design with a variety of colors, AtlasTiles promises you the best material quality.The fountains are elegantly and exquisitely handcrafted by Moroccan artisans with variegated terracotta made from euphonious synchronized colors. The artful patterns of the tiles are encased in a big iron frame similar to the shape of the fountain.The back of the fountain is made of Resin instead of Cement, that way the fountain is lighter, you can easily move it, if you feel like changing a bit of view. Moreover, the iron frame glued to the fountain has wheels so you don\u2019t have to carry it.Let us explain how the fountain works: After you unpack the fountain, make sure you put it somewhere near a socket so you can plug the engine water pump. This is very essential for the circulation of the water you put inside the fountain. There you go, now you can enjoy the sound of water flowing inside you house.A little suggestion from our team: use flavored kind of water in the fountain, that way you get to enjoy the pretty smell as well as the sound. Bring your coffee and come to relax.The fountain comes also with an electric water pump, a mounted spout and a solid packaging so no need to worry about the shipment,and a demonstration of how the fountain works that way you will be able to make it work certainly.Morocco is one of the few countries in the globe having mountains to extract tiles, and one of the best in its production. A unique designs, distinguished colors and famed materials to obtain a high-quality product.The story begins precisely in the area called Ben Jellik. Mountains of raw clay used in Zellige. After the clay is drawn out from the heart of the mountain and took to the four to give it the shape, the clay tiles are paint with colored glass in one of the two sides, then they are levelled and cut. The cutting is done in three phases: First is a form need to be drawn, whether we want triangles or squares or stars, then comes \u201cNequach\u201d or the artisanal responsible of cutting it by hand by a sharp big hammer to give a perfect form to the clay, and finally they use a small hummer to sharp the edges. Then comes the artisan to start putting the individual hand-cut piece of tiles and start making the fountain, upside down which is magical, tells a lot about the expertise of the artisans. When he is done with the fountain, he adds the resin so the tiles stick together and he flips the fountain.You can watch it all in the amazing video in our store.AtlasTiles guarantee to you the total safety in terms of shipment.All our items are handmade and TOP quality.Our Instagram account and Pinterest to check our new items:Instagram : @AtlasTilesPinterest : @ AtlasTilesFor more information, feel free to visit the link bellow:https://www.etsy.com/shop/AtlasTiles/Keywords: Moroccan Tiles Fountain, handmade Tile Fountain, Real Mosaic Fountain Morocco, AtlasTiles Fountain,Interior Decor, Mosaic Artistic Tiles Fountain,Backyard Design Patio Foutain,Morrish Pattern Fountain,Wall Mosaic Fountain,Garden Fountain,wall hanging, Room Decor, oversized, Nursery room, Nursery d\u00e9cor, Large furniture, home d\u00e9cor, gift for mom, Gift for her, gift for grandma, craft room d\u00e9cor, room decor aesthetic, wedding favors, decor wall art original bedroom, decor home, Decor wall, decor for bedroom, decor wall art original,Moon Wall Hanging, Moon Decor,Handmade Hammered mosaic,Boho Bedroom Celestial ArtAtlasTiles team.KEYWORDS : Moroccan Tiles Fountain, handmade Tile Fountain, Real Mosaic Fountain Morocco, AtlasTiles Fountain,Interior Decor, Mosaic Artistic Tiles Fountain,Backyard Design Patio Foutain,Morrish Pattern Fountain,Wall Mosaic Fountain,Garden Fountain,wall hanging, Room Decor, oversized, Nursery room, Nursery d\u00e9cor, Large furniture, home d\u00e9cor, gift for mom, Gift for her, gift for grandma, craft room d\u00e9cor, room decor aesthetic, wedding favors, decor wall art original bedroom, decor home, Decor wall, decor for bedroom, decor wall art original,Moroccan Tile tagine,Andalusian Kitchen Style,Interior Design, Handmade Pottery tagine,Antique tagine,Home D\u00e9cor,Cooking Time, Middle Age Porceline,Real Traditionnal Tile,Indoor Design,Cookware,Keywords: Moroccan Tile Sink,Andalusian Bathroom Style,Interior Design, Handmade Pottery Washbasin,Antique Sink,Home Decor, Middle Age Porceline,Real Traditionnal Tile,Indoor Design,Renovation ideas,Marble Design,Luxury Sink,Decor InspirationNotice :- Please we inform you that the scheme may be incomplete for the small sizes of the items, however the processing time is shorter,and the items are fascinating nevertheless.-We inform you once again that the colors may be slightly different from the real thing due to the Camera/Phone resolution,-Contact us for anything regarding shapes or sizes of custom colors.Thank you",

In this collection, there are nine different shapes, from which all structures of the collection are built. Countless creation options are formed by stacking the shapes one on top of the other into new complex compositions with spectacular colors.On top of the pieces are ceramic prints, inspired by traditions from different cultures, creating a contemporary cultural collage.The designer is engaged in ongoing research, visual as well as theoretical, focusing on \u200ftraditional ceramics as a cultural carrier and \u200fsearching for a sense of belonging through the local material culture.Color: Green, pink, tealMeasurements:Height\t5.9 inchDiameter of 5.5 inch",
