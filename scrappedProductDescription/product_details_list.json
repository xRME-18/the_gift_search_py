I love it!  And because it is wool, it will be easy to clean.  This was the best present my hubby could have given me.  Thank you to A Shop About Love",
      "Love my new sweater! I have wanted a nice white sweater for dress up or dress down and this is it.",
      "This is an incredibly cozy sweater,  made of the softest wool ever (think cashmere); 10 stars for that!  I purchased size XL, looking for relaxed fit - I am usually a size 12 and could have probably gone with a size L.  Wouldn't have been much of an issue except that with the XL, the pockets come down almost mid-thigh, and I am not petite (5'8\").  Last and not least, for the cost, my sweater came with several loose ends, that I will take care of to ensure no unraveling of stitches in the future.  Overall a great purchase - thank you!",
      "Hello, Tutti! Thanks so much for sharing about the sweater. So glad you\u2019re enjoying the coziness. And so sorry about the yarn ends. We work with many knitters in villages in the Andes and I\u2019m sorry this slipped through our own quality checks. But thank you for mentioning it and we\u2019ll work to improve that detail on our end!"

    "description": "Our high-quality doormats are made from all-natural coir fibers, making them eco-friendly. They feature a vinyl back for durability and sturdiness.____________________CARE INSTRUCTIONSWe recommend that coir doormats be used in a covered area to be sheltered from the elements. When coir doormats get wet and cannot dry properly, the fibers can soak up the water. The water then pushes the natural coconut oil to the surface of the fibers giving it a darker and stained appearance. This can also deteriorate the design causing it to fade quickly.Shedding is expected in the beginning while loose fibers from manufacturing are knocked out. Giving your mat a gentle shake can speed the process up. Sweeping or vacuuming can also help. All rugs are unique. Some may be darker or lighter than the photo or have variances of color in the mat. Since coir doormats are made from the husks of coconuts, some fibers may be thicker or thinner than others. There may also be chunks of husks in the fibers. All mats are hand cut, so please allow for a 1 inch +/- variance in length. If you are needing an exact measurement, please reach out to us so we can verify that we can provide one that fits your needs. Doormats are .5 to .75 inches thick.____________________CUSTOM DESIGN OR PERSONALIZATION ADD-ONThis listing is for the design featured in the photos. However, we love to create custom designs. Follow the link below for our custom design listing. If you want this design but want to add to it, such as pawprints, family names, hearts, etc., you can purchase our personalization add-on listing, which is also linked below. Please note that we DO NOT offer proofs for pre-designed items unless specifically requested. All custom orders will get a proof, including orders with personalization add-ons. No proofs will be provided until after purchase.PERSONALIZATION ADD-ON: https://bit.ly/PersonalizedAddOnCUSTOM DESIGN LISTING: https://bit.ly/CustomDesignDoormatIf you have questions regarding proofs, personalizations, or custom options, please feel free to send us a message. We would be glad to answer them for you.____________________BLEMISHED OPTIONSometimes we get mats with dark spots or other stains and blemishes beyond the natural ones mentioned above. However, they do not inhibit the actual function of the doormat. As a company, we try to be mindful of our waste and genuinely hate the thought of throwing them in a landfill; therefore, we choose to offer them at cost. Please note that we do not provide photos of our blemished doormats because our items are made to order, and we cannot guarantee which one you will receive.We usually have at least a few blemished items in stock. If you are interested in purchasing the blemished option, please let us know, and we will be glad to add one if available to the listing inventory. There is a limit of 1 per customer per purchase. By buying a blemished mat, you agree to its flaws, and all sales are final.____________________RESOURCESSHOP HOME PAGE:https://www.etsy.com/shop/hamlinrowshopMORE PERSONALIZED DOORMATS: https://bit.ly/PersonalizeDoormats",

People say: \"Love it\", \"Beautiful\", \"Very well done\", \"Just like the pictures\", \"She loves it!\"\u270eADDITIONAL DETAILS:PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONThis adorably delightful WELCOME sign will add a charming touch to your front door. The sign is made of solid wood with painted on letters, highly durable and it looks great! Our top seller is our 5' x 10\" sign. Check out our reviews! We stain and then give it a distressed and rustic look. Please note, these signs are indeed RUSTIC, and are made one-by-one to that effect which means that each piece has some variation. The distressed look means that the painted letters are given an \"aged\" look. Please review all of the photos and note that parts of the letters have \"aged\" away giving a partly \"erased\" or \"smudged\" look, perhaps even creating some asymmetry in the letters, as well as some color variation in the stain. Given that distressing is done on each piece individually each piece is unique, so expect some slight variation from the model pictured. \u2714CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS TO SEE MORE DETAILS.SPACING & CENTERING ACCURACY: We've made & sold over 15,000 Welcome Signs and one of the things we've been striving for is more precision in the spacing and centering of the letters on our signs. We've invested in new technology and tools that allow us to finely tune the spacing and centering of the letters on our signs so you can be sure that when you receive one of our signs it doesn't look off center or have spacing errors between the letters.SIZESRead our sizes as Height x Width. So if it is a 5' x 10\" sign when reading the measurements the first figure is the height, so 5 feet, and the second number is the width, so 10 inches (technically 9 1/4\" in lumber measurements).  This WELCOME sign comes in 4 sizes!  5 feet x 9 1/4\" , 4 feet by 6 1/2\", 3 feet by 5.5\" inches, and 2 feet by 5.5 inches wide.HOW TO USE ITYour new solid wood welcome sign can be placed anywhere you like by simply resting it back against something as pictured  (For a long life we keep it in a covered location such as a porch with an awning, etc.). Most folks place them near their front door, on a porch, a patio, a deck, walkway or even in a guest room.  If you would like a freestanding sign it is possible to attach a stake on the back and stake it into the ground.PRODUCT CAREWe use one of the most expensive and most durable paints available. This ensures the durability of your sign.  However, like anything exposed to the natural elements (sun, wind, water, etc.) it will wear. We recommend that you place this sign in a covered location, such as a covered porch area.***WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ADDRESS AND THE COLOR & SIZE YOU SELECTED IN YOUR ORDER. THIS IS IMPORTANT AND WILL HELP YOU AVOID UNNECESSARY SHIPPING CHARGES.BROWSE OUR SHOPSee our other stuff:https://www.etsy.com/shop/NativeRange*Native Range, LLC",

Due to the natural characteristics of the product, there may be slight variations of approximately ~0.5\" smaller or larger.\u2022 Photos will be cropped around the corners/edges, as this is the only way to fit a rectangular photo onto an oval piece of wood. All important aspects of the photo should not be located along the very edges of the picture.\u2022 Horizontal photos will be placed horizontally on the wood & vertical photos will be placed vertically unless otherwise requested.\u2022 White ink is not printed on the wood. This allows the natural grain of the wood to show through the photo. Colors of the photo on the wood may vary, as these are printed onto natural wood and not bright white paper.\u2022 A clear protective coating is applied over your wood photo to help protect against stains, water and scratching.\u2022 All wood photos come with complimentary hardware for hanging. If ordering a stand, hanging hardware is not included.\u2022 Stands are not included, but can be purchased separately.\u2022 The bark of the wood is not removed from the wood in order to preserve the natural look of our wood photos.\u2022 All orders are securely packaged with extra bubble wrap for added protection during shipping.\u2022 Made and Handcrafted in Florida, U.S.ACHOOSING YOUR PHOTO:\u2022 The better quality the photo, the better the results will be on the wood.\u2022 A 300 dpi photo taken in good lighting will give you the best possible print results.\u2022 Lower quality photos can be used, but please know that the quality will be the same on the wood.\u2022 Extremely dark, blurry, grainy or low-quality photos do not typically transfer well.\u2022 We ask that you DO NOT add any text to your photo, due to cropping reasons.ENGRAVINGS:\u2022 Looking for a way to make the back of the wood as beautiful as the front? Consider adding on one of our engraving options.\u2022 Select from a variety of premade and personalized designs and have them ENGRAVED onto the back of your wood photo.\u2022 Scroll through listing photos to see available engraving options.\u2022 Our custom text engraving option allows you to have any custom text engraved onto the back of the wood in the font that is shown. There is no character limit, but the longer the text is, the smaller it will be to fit onto the wood.\u2022 Our custom handwritten text engraving option allows you to add handwritten text to the back of the wood. For handwritten text, please send us a message through Etsy with an attachment that includes a digital or scanned copy of the handwritten text that you'd like engraved. Handwritten text MUST BE ON A PLAIN PAPER BACKGROUND. Text written on lined paper or paper with background designs will not work. The clearer the text is, the better the engraving will be.\u2022 Please keep in mind that because this is real wood, there may be some natural knots/marks on the piece. These may be more noticeable on the back of the wood than on the front, as there is no photo to cover them.HOW TO PLACE AN ORDER:1.

There is nothing I love more than taking quiet time for myself out on the water.Printed on Epson Velvet Fine Art Paper because it is very similar to the original paper these were painted on. Options for paper size are:8.5 X 11 inches  $5013X19 inches     $7017 X 22 inches   $85Not all images fit standard paper sizes and may need custom frames.Most images can be custom printed larger on paper or canvas, just go to \"custom\" or convo me with you wish and I will do everything to make it happen.Each print is packaged in a  protective, acid-free sleeve and shipped in a flat cardboard mailer. I usually ship the print by regular mail the day after I receive the order. I am very happy to accommodate special orders like larger prints or portraits. Prices do apply.Please feel free to convo me with any questions or requests. I love comments and convos from people around the world!",
