I already ordered a medium that normally fits me, and this shirt did not and had to give that to my sister and then ordered a large and it really was not that much bigger in size.",

      "Perfect! Exactly as I ordered and very high quality. Excited to display these in my home.",
      "I didn't realize the tallest piece would be four inches high, so this set was smaller than anticipated, but I found it to be even better than expected as a result. I gave one of the sets to my friends who have a four-year old son, and he loved opening the packages of the pieces and looking closely at each of them. I specifically wanted a set that would be interactive for children, and this definitely is. Wood is sanded to a soft finish, but pieces are sturdy and not at risk of breakage. It will also be terrific to use in the weeks leading up to Easter, as the pieces can be arranged to illustrate Christ in many instances of His life and ministry. Perfect touch that His hands are marked only on one side of the figure. It is beautiful, and a long-overdue addition to my home. Thank you!",
      "Thank you for your feedback, Jeslyn!\nIt made my day! We are so happy to make something special for you to become your little traditions and at the same to be a toy with a deep meaning.\nSoincerely, your BusyPuzzle team",
      "Loved it. It was just what I wanted."

    "description": "YELLOW -  PANORAMIC SUGAR EASTER EGGThis is a fresh and edible 2024 Panoramic Sugar Easter Egg.  This Easter Egg is a buttery YELLOW.   I have been selling my Easter Eggs on Etsy since 2011 and am proud of the extra steps I take for you to enjoy them.  Once you smell this sweet smell you will be so glad you have a choice to eat it, or decorate with it for years to come (can be easily stored for years).I hand craft them one at a time using Sugar, Confectioners Powdered Sugar, Meringue Powder, Water and Food Coloring.  No two eggs are exactly the same and are so fun to look at.  Included on the inside of each Easter Egg is a handmade Bunny, Carrot, Flowers, Grass, Clouds in the Sky, a Forsythia in bloom, a Bird in the sky and a white Picket Fence with flower vines growing up the posts.  This egg measures 4\" tall x 3 1/2\" wide.Years ago when I decided I would try crafting these vintage Victorian styled eggs I wanted to change it up a little and put my own modern and whimsical twist on them.  The outside is sweet and simple with the true \"surprise\" on the inside (as you can see by the group picture of my eggs, the flower colors and arrangements on each egg vary).I am making a variety of eggs in several different colors daily, including my own unique multi-colored \"Speckled Eggs\", so check out the other eggs in my shop.  If you wish to order multiple eggs/colors please place all of the eggs in your cart, make 1 easy payment and automatically receive your combined shipping discount ($10.00 first egg with $5.00 each additional egg).This egg will arrive to you in a clear bag with a bow tied and ready to give as a gift.  If you would like me to ship as gifts to multiple addresses you will need to place a separate order for each address. Shipping to the US only.  I ship USPS Priority Mail daily Monday - Friday.  Personalizing this egg with a name in white icing will add a small fee and will delay the shipping time.  The closer to Easter the quantities may be limited so please order early.Thank you for supporting my small business and for visiting my shop!Please message me with any questions you may have.",
