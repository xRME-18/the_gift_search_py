    "description": "Whether you're looking for an Easter gift, or a way to decorate your home, this original hand painted ornament is a way of doing so with style and meaning.Growing up in a traditional polish household, I was raised with the custom of hand decorating eggs for Easter. Nowadays, I put my own modern spin on this rich symbolic tradition; covering the eggs with everything from decorative patterns to floral motifs-  the possibilities are endless!This wooden hen egg has been hand painted with acrylic terra cotta paints which give it slight texture and a vintage accent. I painted a fox surrounded by a floral wreath and some more florals in the back of the egg to fit the scene. It was then coated with a water based satin finish.Each egg is made of solid wood.The small hen egg (round or flat bottom) weighs approximately 1.5 oz and is 2.5\" tall and 1.75\" wide.The medium goose egg weighs approximately 3.4 oz and is 3 1/4\" tall and 2 3/16\" wide.The large goose egg weighs approximately 6.6 oz and is 4 1/4\" tall and 2 3/4\" wide.They all have a flat bottom for easy standing.There is also an option to purchase an egg stand or cup for the 2.5\" round or flat bottom hen egg. The egg stand is 1-1/8\u2033 tall x 1-3/4\u2033 wide and the egg cup is 2-1/8\u2033 tall x 1-11/16\u2033 wide. I paint the egg stand/ cup to match the color scheme and design of the egg ornament you choose.The primary color options refer to the background color of the egg.Due to the hand painted nature of this product, no ornament is exactly the same - every piece is one a of kind and that's the beauty of it!If you'd like to personalize your egg, please note that the surface is rather small, so the shorter the message the better it will look.  Personalization is free of charge.Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be glad to help out.The eggs will be carefully and sustainably packaged so they arrive to you in perfect condition.*Colors may vary due to monitor settings.",

If you are ordering a larger quantity please contact me in advance to make sure that I have the availability for the order.Shipping:I take great care to seal the cookies in bags and then wrap the cookies in bubble wrap bags. Cookies are then placed in a box with crinkle paper and packing peanuts. A cookie may occasionally break or crack. I do not offer refunds for breakage, as I cannot control how your package is handled by the post office. I promise though, the cookies will always taste delicious!Storing Cookies:Cookies can stay fresh for a couple weeks if stored in the bags or a sealed container away from sunlight. No need to be put in the fridge. Cookies stay fresh at room temperature.Cookies are 2 inches tall.",

    "description": "Pendant Ceramic Lamp, Hanging Lampshade, Handmade Design, Contemporary Artwork Creation, Unique Light Fixture Gift, Suitable for Living Room Center & Office by Noa RazerThis piece was created in the innovative studio of the designer-maker Noa Razer, which is located in Tel Aviv, Israel, and It is part of the Apilar collection.The Apilar collection ('stack' in Spanish) began to take shape during a family roots trip to southern Spain, influenced by the differentiated and unique Spanish ceramics. In this collection, there are nine different shapes, from which all structures of the collection are built. Countless creation options are formed by stacking the shapes one on top of the other into new complex compositions with spectacular colors.On top of the pieces are ceramic prints, inspired by traditions from different cultures, creating a contemporary cultural collage.The designer is engaged in ongoing research, visual as well as theoretical, focusing on \u200ftraditional ceramics as a cultural carrier and \u200fsearching for a sense of belonging through the local material culture.Color: Green, pink, tealMeasurements:Height\t5.9 inchDiameter of 5.5 inch",
