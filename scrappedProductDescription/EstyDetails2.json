    "description": "Although these are made to order, I have several in stock ready to ship. Please let me know if you need these ASAP!Making this delicate egg begins by sketching a design on a clean, blown chicken eggshell. Then a high-speed drill is used to hand carve the pattern shown above. This listing is for a single egg. Yours will be cut in a wreath pattern with minor variations, making each a unique work of art and a rare and beautiful wonder of nature.See the carving process at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZ-TFuIxDQThe egg featured above is a jumbo chicken egg. Vines and flowers create a graceful oval wreath design on one side of the 2 1/2-inch shell.Please use the drop-down menu to select egg colors: natural brown, white, or dyed shades: Hyacinth, Grass Green, Pink, Robins Egg, or Blue.In most cases, I will select your egg from inventory but I may need to carve one based on your color choice. So... to accommodate variations in my schedule - especially during holiday seasons - please allow me up to 2 weeks to complete and prepare your order for shipping.All eggs come with complimentary Lucite stands and are beautifully packaged. They are wrapped with great care and shipped via USPS.  If this is to be sent as a gift, alert me and I will remove pricing from the packing slip. Feel free to write a message to the recipient at checkout and I will include your remarks in a card.The Victorians were quite fond of ornamentation and decorated their Easter eggs with snippets of daily life: trade cards, ribbons, beads, and bits of old lace. The eggs I create today are etched or carved in patterns reminiscent of fine Victorian lace, and so I call these delicate, dainty works of art Victorian Lace Eggs.\u00ae",

The egg is pleasant to hold in hands, it has a smooth surface and unique design.You can use the egg as the Easter basket stuffer or make it a part of a funny egg hunt game :)\u2605DIMENSIONSEgg height - 7.5 cm (2.95 in)Egg diameter - 4.5 cm (1.77 in).\u2605 UNIQUE DESIGN HAND-MADE WITH LOVE:It was carefully hand-painted by me with Petrykivka painting ornament included in the list of cultural inheritance of the world by UNESCO. Petrykivka painting is a traditional Ukrainian decorative painting style named after the village it originated from. The people of the village of Petrykivka (where I am from) decorate their homes, household belongings with a style of ornamental painting that is characterized by fantastic flowers, birds and other natural elements. In folk belief, the paintings protect people from sorrow and evil.After painting I covered the wooden egg with 3 layers of waterproof varnish to provide long life and never tarnishing colors.The painting traditions are transferred from one generation to another. So it was transferred to me and as an artist I create my items with this knowledge.\u2605 PACKAGING AND SHIPPINGYour Easter egg will be nicely and safely packed and shipped with airmail with the tracking number.Also, there is the \"expedited shipping\" option - 7-10 workdays, just chose \"expedited shipping\" at checkout :)A pleasant bonus - shipping for orders of 35$ and more is free, so you can get more lovely pieces shipped for free.You can see more Easter accessories in my shop herehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/RainbowOnThePipe?ref=seller-platform-mcnav\u00a7ion_id=21225686Take a look at other things in my shophttps://www.etsy.com/shop/RainbowOnTheWood?ref=l2-shopheader-namePlease, contact me if you have some questions, I will be glad to communicate with you!Love,Angelina",

    "description": "Create your own reusable, sustainable wooden Easter eggs. These hollow wood eggs are prefect for filling with small treats!A set of 6 (six) unfinished eggs that open, made from Linden wood. These eggs are about 2 3/4 inch tall.  Each egg is hand made so slight size and shape variations will happen - tops and bottoms from each egg often aren't interchangeable with each other. Also, every piece of wood is unique, each egg will have  it's own natural gain and or spots.  The insides are lightly sanded but not as sanded as the outside and can sometimes have rough spots.  These eggs come in a cloth bag or carton, you pick. Cartons are made from recycled paper pulp - colors and thickness can vary. As these eggs are bigger than chicken eggs they won't fit in regular cartons/holdersSince wood is a porous natural material it can shrink and swell depending on temperatures and moisture which can make the eggs difficult to open or not stay closed on their own depending on the season.  **Painting on the inside of the egg (especially the rim where the two eggs parts meet) can cause the eggs to swell and not be able to open.**Using washable paint (and water color or food dyes) can cause the paint/dye to transfer when wet (wet grass or wet hands/mouths).  This project would be best done by older kids or adults that can use non washable paints that would be more permanent on the wood. This listing is just for the wooden eggs, no paint is included.You can also leave the eggs unpainted and let the woods natural beauty shine through or you can bring out the natural beauty even more with a wood polishhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/875928794Don't want to get messy...
