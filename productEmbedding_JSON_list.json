Giving your mat a gentle shake can speed the process up. Sweeping or vacuuming can also help. All rugs are unique. Some may be darker or lighter than the photo or have variances of color in the mat. Since coir doormats are made from the husks of coconuts, some fibers may be thicker or thinner than others. There may also be chunks of husks in the fibers.

People say: \"Love it\", \"Beautiful\", \"Very well done\", \"Just like the pictures\", \"She loves it!\"\n\n\u270eADDITIONAL DETAILS:\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION\nThis adorably delightful WELCOME sign will add a charming touch to your front door. The sign is made of solid wood with painted on letters, highly durable and it looks great! Our top seller is our 5' x 10\" sign. Check out our reviews! We stain and then give it a distressed and rustic look. Please note, these signs are indeed RUSTIC, and are made one-by-one to that effect which means that each piece has some variation. The distressed look means that the painted letters are given an \"aged\" look. Please review all of the photos and note that parts of the letters have \"aged\" away giving a partly \"erased\" or \"smudged\" look, perhaps even creating some asymmetry in the letters, as well as some color variation in the stain. Given that distressing is done on each piece individually each piece is unique, so expect some slight variation from the model pictured.\n\n\u2714CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS TO SEE MORE DETAILS.\n\nSPACING & CENTERING ACCURACY: We've made & sold over 15,000 Welcome Signs and one of the things we've been striving for is more precision in the spacing and centering of the letters on our signs. We've invested in new technology and tools that allow us to finely tune the spacing and centering of the letters on our signs so you can be sure that when you receive one of our signs it doesn't look off center or have spacing errors between the letters.\n\nSIZES\nRead our sizes as Height x Width. So if it is a 5' x 10\" sign when reading the measurements the first figure is the height, so 5 feet, and the second number is the width, so 10 inches (technically 9 1/4\" in lumber measurements).  This WELCOME sign comes in 4 sizes!  5 feet x 9 1/4\" , 4 feet by 6 1/2\", 3 feet by 5.5\" inches, and 2 feet by 5.5 inches wide.\n\nHOW TO USE IT\nYour new solid wood welcome sign can be placed anywhere you like by simply resting it back against something as pictured  (For a long life we keep it in a covered location such as a porch with an awning, etc.). Most folks place them near their front door, on a porch, a patio, a deck, walkway or even in a guest room.  If you would like a freestanding sign it is possible to attach a stake on the back and stake it into the ground.\n\nPRODUCT CARE\nWe use one of the most expensive and most durable paints available. This ensures the durability of your sign.  However, like anything exposed to the natural elements (sun, wind, water, etc.) it will wear. We recommend that you place this sign in a covered location, such as a covered porch area.\n\n***WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ADDRESS AND THE COLOR & SIZE YOU SELECTED IN YOUR ORDER. THIS IS IMPORTANT AND WILL HELP YOU AVOID UNNECESSARY SHIPPING CHARGES.\n\nBROWSE OUR SHOP\nSee our other stuff:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/NativeRange\n*Native Range, LLC",

It is said that wood elements within your home can bring balance to your space and life. \n\nEach piece of wood will vary in wood grain, making each one completely unique. \nSeveral size options available to choose from. Due to the natural characteristics of the product, there may be slight variations of approximately ~0.5\" smaller or larger. \nPhotos will be cropped around the corners/edges, as this is the only way to fit a rectangular photo onto an oval piece of wood. All important aspects of the photo should not be located along the very edges of the picture. \nHorizontal photos will be placed horizontally on the wood & vertical photos will be placed vertically unless otherwise requested. \nWhite ink is not printed on the wood. This allows the natural grain of the wood to show through the photo. Colors of the photo on the wood may vary, as these are printed onto natural wood and not bright white paper. \nA clear protective coating is applied over your wood photo to help protect against stains, water and scratching. \nAll wood photos come with complimentary hardware for hanging. If ordering a stand, hanging hardware is not included. \nStands are not included, but can be purchased separately. \nThe bark of the wood is not removed from the wood in order to preserve the natural look of our wood photos. \nAll orders are securely packaged with extra bubble wrap for added protection during shipping. \nMade and Handcrafted in Florida, U.S.A.",

Most images can be custom printed larger on paper or canvas, just go to \"custom\" or convo me with you wish and I will do everything to make it happen. Each print is packaged in a protective, acid-free sleeve and shipped in a flat cardboard mailer. I usually ship the print by regular mail the day after I receive the order.
