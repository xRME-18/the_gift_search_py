Last and not least, for the cost, my sweater came with several loose ends, that I will take care of to ensure no unraveling of stitches in the future.  Overall a great purchase - thank you!",
      "Hello, Tutti! Thanks so much for sharing about the sweater. So glad you\u2019re enjoying the coziness. And so sorry about the yarn ends. We work with many knitters in villages in the Andes and I\u2019m sorry this slipped through our own quality checks. But thank you for mentioning it and we\u2019ll work to improve that detail on our end!"

    "description": "Our high-quality doormats are made from all-natural coir fibers, making them eco-friendly. They feature a vinyl back for durability and sturdiness.____________________CARE INSTRUCTIONSWe recommend that coir doormats be used in a covered area to be sheltered from the elements. When coir doormats get wet and cannot dry properly, the fibers can soak up the water. The water then pushes the natural coconut oil to the surface of the fibers giving it a darker and stained appearance. This can also deteriorate the design causing it to fade quickly.Shedding is expected in the beginning while loose fibers from manufacturing are knocked out. Giving your mat a gentle shake can speed the process up. Sweeping or vacuuming can also help. All rugs are unique. Some may be darker or lighter than the photo or have variances of color in the mat. Since coir doormats are made from the husks of coconuts, some fibers may be thicker or thinner than others. There may also be chunks of husks in the fibers. All mats are hand cut, so please allow for a 1 inch +/- variance in length. If you are needing an exact measurement, please reach out to us so we can verify that we can provide one that fits your needs. Doormats are .5 to .75 inches thick.____________________CUSTOM DESIGN OR PERSONALIZATION ADD-ONThis listing is for the design featured in the photos. However, we love to create custom designs. Follow the link below for our custom design listing. If you want this design but want to add to it, such as pawprints, family names, hearts, etc., you can purchase our personalization add-on listing, which is also linked below. Please note that we DO NOT offer proofs for pre-designed items unless specifically requested. All custom orders will get a proof, including orders with personalization add-ons. No proofs will be provided until after purchase.PERSONALIZATION ADD-ON: https://bit.ly/PersonalizedAddOnCUSTOM DESIGN LISTING: https://bit.ly/CustomDesignDoormatIf you have questions regarding proofs, personalizations, or custom options, please feel free to send us a message. We would be glad to answer them for you.____________________BLEMISHED OPTIONSometimes we get mats with dark spots or other stains and blemishes beyond the natural ones mentioned above. However, they do not inhibit the actual function of the doormat. As a company, we try to be mindful of our waste and genuinely hate the thought of throwing them in a landfill; therefore, we choose to offer them at cost. Please note that we do not provide photos of our blemished doormats because our items are made to order, and we cannot guarantee which one you will receive.We usually have at least a few blemished items in stock. If you are interested in purchasing the blemished option, please let us know, and we will be glad to add one if available to the listing inventory. There is a limit of 1 per customer per purchase. By buying a blemished mat, you agree to its flaws, and all sales are final.____________________RESOURCESSHOP HOME PAGE:https://www.etsy.com/shop/hamlinrowshopMORE PERSONALIZED DOORMATS: https://bit.ly/PersonalizeDoormats",

People say: \"Love it\", \"Beautiful\", \"Very well done\", \"Just like the pictures\", \"She loves it!\"\u270eADDITIONAL DETAILS:PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONThis adorably delightful WELCOME sign will add a charming touch to your front door. The sign is made of solid wood with painted on letters, highly durable and it looks great! Our top seller is our 5' x 10\" sign. Check out our reviews! We stain and then give it a distressed and rustic look. Please note, these signs are indeed RUSTIC, and are made one-by-one to that effect which means that each piece has some variation. The distressed look means that the painted letters are given an \"aged\" look. Please review all of the photos and note that parts of the letters have \"aged\" away giving a partly \"erased\" or \"smudged\" look, perhaps even creating some asymmetry in the letters, as well as some color variation in the stain. Given that distressing is done on each piece individually each piece is unique, so expect some slight variation from the model pictured. \u2714CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS TO SEE MORE DETAILS.SPACING & CENTERING ACCURACY: We've made & sold over 15,000 Welcome Signs and one of the things we've been striving for is more precision in the spacing and centering of the letters on our signs. We've invested in new technology and tools that allow us to finely tune the spacing and centering of the letters on our signs so you can be sure that when you receive one of our signs it doesn't look off center or have spacing errors between the letters.SIZESRead our sizes as Height x Width. So if it is a 5' x 10\" sign when reading the measurements the first figure is the height, so 5 feet, and the second number is the width, so 10 inches (technically 9 1/4\" in lumber measurements).  This WELCOME sign comes in 4 sizes!  5 feet x 9 1/4\" , 4 feet by 6 1/2\", 3 feet by 5.5\" inches, and 2 feet by 5.5 inches wide.HOW TO USE ITYour new solid wood welcome sign can be placed anywhere you like by simply resting it back against something as pictured  (For a long life we keep it in a covered location such as a porch with an awning, etc.). Most folks place them near their front door, on a porch, a patio, a deck, walkway or even in a guest room.  If you would like a freestanding sign it is possible to attach a stake on the back and stake it into the ground.PRODUCT CAREWe use one of the most expensive and most durable paints available. This ensures the durability of your sign.  However, like anything exposed to the natural elements (sun, wind, water, etc.) it will wear. We recommend that you place this sign in a covered location, such as a covered porch area.***WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ADDRESS AND THE COLOR & SIZE YOU SELECTED IN YOUR ORDER. THIS IS IMPORTANT AND WILL HELP YOU AVOID UNNECESSARY SHIPPING CHARGES.BROWSE OUR SHOPSee our other stuff:https://www.etsy.com/shop/NativeRange*Native Range, LLC",

    "description": "If you're searching for the perfect 5th anniversary gift or gift for any other occasion, look no further than our rustic wood photos. A wood anniversary gift is a great, traditional option for your 5th year of marriage. Not only are our custom pictures on wood ideal for anniversaries, but also make perfect gifts for weddings, housewarmings and so much more!ABOUT OUR WOOD PHOTOS:Have your own custom photo printed directly onto round basswood, with no margins or gaps. The photograph becomes an integral part of the wood, ensuring that it will stand the test of time. The natural wood shows through the photo for a beautiful, rustic, and \"worn\" look. It is said that wood elements within your home can bring balance to your space and life.Purchasing as a GIFT? Add-on our gift wrapping option and have your custom wood photo wrapped in a natural burlap gift bag -https://www.etsy.com/listing/522661329/burlap-gift-bags-gift-wrapping-add-onDETAILS:\u2022 Because this is wood from a real tree, pieces may have knots which we try to place in the best spots possible for the photo provided.\u2022 Each piece of wood will vary in wood grain, making each one completely unique.\u2022 Several size options available to choose from. Due to the natural characteristics of the product, there may be slight variations of approximately ~0.5\" smaller or larger.\u2022 Photos will be cropped around the corners/edges, as this is the only way to fit a rectangular photo onto an oval piece of wood. All important aspects of the photo should not be located along the very edges of the picture.\u2022 Horizontal photos will be placed horizontally on the wood & vertical photos will be placed vertically unless otherwise requested.\u2022 White ink is not printed on the wood. This allows the natural grain of the wood to show through the photo. Colors of the photo on the wood may vary, as these are printed onto natural wood and not bright white paper.\u2022 A clear protective coating is applied over your wood photo to help protect against stains, water and scratching.\u2022 All wood photos come with complimentary hardware for hanging. If ordering a stand, hanging hardware is not included.\u2022 Stands are not included, but can be purchased separately.\u2022 The bark of the wood is not removed from the wood in order to preserve the natural look of our wood photos.\u2022 All orders are securely packaged with extra bubble wrap for added protection during shipping.\u2022 Made and Handcrafted in Florida, U.S.ACHOOSING YOUR PHOTO:\u2022 The better quality the photo, the better the results will be on the wood.\u2022 A 300 dpi photo taken in good lighting will give you the best possible print results.\u2022 Lower quality photos can be used, but please know that the quality will be the same on the wood.\u2022 Extremely dark, blurry, grainy or low-quality photos do not typically transfer well.\u2022 We ask that you DO NOT add any text to your photo, due to cropping reasons.ENGRAVINGS:\u2022 Looking for a way to make the back of the wood as beautiful as the front? Consider adding on one of our engraving options.\u2022 Select from a variety of premade and personalized designs and have them ENGRAVED onto the back of your wood photo.\u2022 Scroll through listing photos to see available engraving options.\u2022 Our custom text engraving option allows you to have any custom text engraved onto the back of the wood in the font that is shown. There is no character limit, but the longer the text is, the smaller it will be to fit onto the wood.\u2022 Our custom handwritten text engraving option allows you to add handwritten text to the back of the wood. For handwritten text, please send us a message through Etsy with an attachment that includes a digital or scanned copy of the handwritten text that you'd like engraved. Handwritten text MUST BE ON A PLAIN PAPER BACKGROUND. Text written on lined paper or paper with background designs will not work. The clearer the text is, the better the engraving will be.\u2022 Please keep in mind that because this is real wood, there may be some natural knots/marks on the piece. These may be more noticeable on the back of the wood than on the front, as there is no photo to cover them.HOW TO PLACE AN ORDER:1. Purchase this wood photo listing along with any upgrades that you'd like from the drop-down menus.2.

Each 24x36 inches.When you buy these tree ring prints, you\u2019re getting actual handmade woodcut prints, not something printed from a machine. That\u2019s because I consider each a work of art that is as unique as the tree I make them from. I also don\u2019t believe in cutting down trees to make my art. I travel to meaningful places to find wood from previously fallen trees. In a way, I\u2019m just publishing the story of a place as written by a tree over decades and sometimes hundreds of years. I sign each print because I stand by my work. If you\u2019re not happy with the artwork I will give you a full refund, no questions asked.In the main photo, the print on the far left is driftwood from Tillamook, Oregon. The middle print is made from a beautiful Ash tree that comes from Midwestern United states. The print on the far right is from the Crater Lake area, just outside of the National Park. The tree is more than 100 years old.  You get a great discount buying these three prints in a set, rather than individually:)****I\u2019m more than happy to customize the color and the paper size for you.

This gives an attractive depth to each number, allowing the number to stand out against the natural slate.

    "description": "Pure beeswax candles made with wax sourced from the finest US east coast apiaries. Handmade, one at a time, by me in my Hudson Valley NY studio. Beautiful beeswax candles have a natural honey scent, burn longer and brighter than other types of wax candles, and are considered \u201cdripless,\u201d if burned correctly, undisturbed, away from any drafts, and in a properly sized holder appropriate for burning candles. There is no guarantee that beeswax candles will not drip or run, so appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid melted beeswax getting on tablecloths, surfaces, etc.  Each pair of 12 x 7/8\" tapers is approximately 6 oz. These candles will fit most standard candle holders. Tapered candles shown in a rainbow selection. See other photos for more colors. Be sure to select ONE color PER PAIR of candles at checkout.-This listing is for ONE PAIR of candles. One pair = two individual taper candles- 100% natural beeswax from established northeast US beekeepers.- Organic cotton wick.- Each 12\" taper burns approximately 12-14 hours, depending on conditions in the environment. Please don\u2019t burn in drafty areas. This negatively affects burn time and promotes dripping.- Smokeless, relatively \u201cdripless\u201d when correctly burned, and non-allergenic.- Handmade candles have naturally occurring imperfections that enhance their rustic loveliness, so please allow for some inconsistencies.- Ivory and yellow candles are un-dyed, un-bleached, pure filtered beeswax.- Colored candles are dyed with eco-friendly, non-toxic dyes. Note that colors may appear slightly different in person due to variations in computer monitors. Colors may also vary slightly from batch to batch.- Handmade candles have naturally occurring imperfections that enhance their rustic loveliness. Please allow for minor inconsistencies.Handmade to order! Please contact me ahead of ordering if you want to arrange a rush order.",

Each piece is sanded on front and back before being painted to your color choice. If you would like a distressed finish, we sand the paint to create this rustic look. To get this option, mention it in the Notes box at check-out.WALL HANGING:Our key hole hanging option is a ready-to-hang system and includes all the hardware you need for mounting to wood or drywall.  Key hole slots are cut in the back of the word and screws are included. This hanging method is sturdy and invisible. All you will need is a Phillips-head screwdriver.  Select this option in the dropdown menu on the left before adding to your cart.Our standard option does not include hanging hardware.  Some good methods for hanging are: Command Strips, glue, or small nails in the open spaces of the letters.Because of the nature of the lettering, it is somewhat fragile and we recommend hanging it securely and out of reach of kids or pets.LEAD TIME:Each item is made to order. Our lead time is approximately 1-2 weeks after receiving payment. Items are shipped using USPS priority mail which arrives in 2-3 days. We cannot guarantee shipping times; these are just estimates.

A character represents a single letter or number.ABOUT THE MAKERS: Each piece is thoughtfully designed and created from scratch by us, Brandon and Erin Spangler, in Northwest Georgia. We use a CNC laser table to cut out our raw steel creations and then run each item through our finishing machine. Afterwards we hand tie a piece twine along with our story / care instructions card to every item.MATERIALS:Our creations are made out of 14 gauge hot-rolled mild steel covered with a thin layer of black oxide (magnetite) which is responsible for its dark gray/bluish tint. While this provides a level of protection against corrosion, a beautiful patina of rust can be brought out by a minimal amount of exposure to humidity. If the rust is unwelcome you may rub grade 3 coarse steel wool over the top to remove any and/or all rust.RAW STEEL MATERIAL: We use raw 14 gauge hot-rolled mild industrial steel, which the most recycled material in the world. The color, shades, and variations in the raw steel (raw metal) appearance varies from sheet to sheet. Due to the nature of working with recycled materials each piece will likely vary from the picture.Since metals are inherently recyclable and can be used over and over again, minimizing their negative environmental impacts and saving energy. So please keep in mind that each piece may vary from the picture as our raw metal is created from recycled steel giving little variations (such as color) to each sheet.****PLEASE NOTE*****Please make sure that you fill in the correct shipping address at the time of purchase in the provided shipping information section (not the special notes), or the destination of your order is not guaranteed.",

The tapestry is a few inches shorter on both sides to allow room for tying the hanging string onto the ends of the stick.The height or vertical length is measured form the wooden rod to the bottom of the yarn. The measurement does not include the string that the tapestry hangs from, which is an additional 6-9 inches.I spend a lot of time browsing for unique and quality yarn. I love to mix different textures and sizes to give some of the tapestries more depth and dimensions. I have begun to see my tapestries as an art form!I do love custom orders. It gives me the opportunity to be creative and make something new! If you have a certain color scheme for a room please allow me to make it for you! That being said, please understand that yarn color is not like paint. I cannot mix it to create the perfect match to your dresser or bedspread. If you want \"harvest orange\" when I go to the craft store there may only be three options of orange color of which \"harvest orange\" is not one of them. I do try to match them as close as possible. Computerized images of color schemes are more effective then photos taken with your phone because lighting can really alter the actual color.Expedited Shipping Information: If you need your tapestry sooner then the allotted time required to make it, please purchase the \"Work on My Order Next and Expedite the Shipping\" listed in my shop for $40.  I truly wish I had hand weaving superpowers and the ability to ship them quicker! Unfortunately, I do not :)CURRENT SHIPPING TIMES: The expected delivery time is just an ESTIMATE. Please understand that USPS and I are working as fast as we can, but there may be some orders where the delivery time is a bit later than the listed expected date. I am also a high school teacher and some weeks I'm very busy volunteering and working late with students, parents or staff. I just want to be as transparent as possible. I ask that you only place your order if you are willing to accept that depending on my work week, the package could be a bit later then expected.ALL proceeds go to a miniature horse rescue and a kids summer camp where they learn to care for mini horses.Returns and exchanges: Please be considerate about returns (for not only my shop but other Etsy shops as well). Keep in mind that we spend time shopping for material, prepping for your purchase, creating the product, packaging, and delivering for shipment. We are not Amazon, but individual crafters. When you return something that means we pay out money for shipping and processing fees, plus hours of working on your order. I will   most definitely accept a return however, the cost of shipping it back is the responsibility of the purchaser. Once the tapestry is returned, I will refund you for the price of the tapestry.

I am the co-owner of Divider Records, Brit, writing to inform you of the authenticity of our products.I am an Etsy customer myself.

You may choose your wing color & body may be black or silver in tone.Each one is hand made from art glass, and each piece is unique.  Yours will vary from the one shown due to natural variances in the glass and the hand made nature of the piece.If you would like a color not currently shown, please contact me and I'll see if I can arrange it for you.IMPORTANT DRAGON TRAVEL TIME INFORMATION:Dragons typically take about 4 weeks to housetrain (roughly--sometimes they're quick learners, sometimes they're feisty).If you need your dragon faster, you may consider adding the RUSH OPTION to your order, when available.  You can find it here if it is currently available:https://www.etsy.com/listing/1039130235/Rush Orders will get your dragon a crash course in housetraining, and have him out to you in 1-2 weeks instead.While I always do my best to get your dragon out quickly, housetraining may occasionally take longer than estimated if many dragons need training around the same time.  If that happens, please bear with me, I'm the only dragon trainer here.  Also, the Rush Option will only be available when I am available to work overtime, and will not appear if I am already backed up or traveling for shows.Be sure to check out my other items, too!  :)",
