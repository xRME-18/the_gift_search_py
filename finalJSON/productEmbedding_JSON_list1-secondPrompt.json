      "description": "Eco-friendly doormat made from all-natural coir fibers with a vinyl back for durability.  \n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nWe recommend that coir doormats be used in a covered area to be sheltered from the elements. When coir doormats get wet and cannot dry properly, the fibers can soak up the water. The water then pushes the natural coconut oil to the surface of the fibers giving it a darker and stained appearance. This can also deteriorate the design causing it to fade quickly.\nShedding is expected in the beginning while loose fibers from manufacturing are knocked out. Giving your mat a gentle shake can speed the process up. Sweeping or vacuuming can also help. \n\nAll rugs are unique. Some may be darker or lighter than the photo or have variances of color in the mat. Since coir doormats are made from the husks of coconuts, some fibers may be thicker or thinner than others. There may also be chunks of husks in the fibers. \n\nAll mats are hand cut, so please allow for a 1 inch +/- variance in length. If you are needing an exact measurement, please reach out to us so we can verify that we can provide one that fits your needs. \n\nDoormats are .5 to .75 inches thick.\n\nCUSTOM DESIGN OR PERSONALIZATION ADD-ON\nThis listing is for the design featured in the photos. However, we love to create custom designs. Follow the link below for our custom design listing. If you want this design but want to add to it, such as pawprints, family names, hearts, etc., you can purchase our personalization add-on listing, which is also linked below. \n\nPlease note that we DO NOT offer proofs for pre-designed items unless specifically requested. All custom orders will get a proof, including orders with personalization add-ons.\n\nNo proofs will be provided until after purchase.\n\nPERSONALIZATION ADD-ON: https://bit.ly/PersonalizedAddOn\nCUSTOM DESIGN LISTING: https://bit.ly/CustomDesignDoormat\n\nIf you have questions regarding proofs, personalizations, or custom options, please feel free to send us a message. We would be glad to answer them for you.\n\nBLEMISHED OPTION\nSometimes we get mats with dark spots or other stains and blemishes beyond the natural ones mentioned above. However, they do not inhibit the actual function of the doormat. As a company, we try to be mindful of our waste and genuinely hate the thought of throwing them in a landfill; therefore, we choose to offer them at cost. \n\nPlease note that we do not provide photos of our blemished doormats because our items are made to order, and we cannot guarantee which one you will receive.\n\nWe usually have at least a few blemished items in stock. If you are interested in purchasing the blemished option, please let us know, and we will be glad to add one if available to the listing inventory. There is a limit of 1 per customer per purchase. By buying a blemished mat, you agree to its flaws, and all sales are final.",

If you do not give us an EST. date, we will automatically leave that off. We can also put anything else on this design besides a last name, PLEASE make sure that you are very clear in your description when placing your order. If you have any questions, please send us a message and we'd be happy to help!\nOur doormats are high quality 100% coir. They are hand painted by me with outdoor industrial paint that has a built in UV protection to help protect the design from wear and fading. Each mat is backed with a slip-resistant sturdy PVC rubber backing. We offer a variety of sizes and all of our mats are 1 inch thick.\nThe mats are best placed under a covered area such as a porch, we do not recommend placing mat in areas of direct sunlight, rain, or snow.\nCARE: clean by giving the mat a good shake. Best to keep in a dry area such as a covered entryway, we DO NOT recommend direct sunlight, rain or snow as that will fade & cause wear to your doormat!\nDue to the nature of our product, RETURNS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED DUE TO WEAR OR FADING. Doormats will not be refunded or replaced from wear.*FLAWED DOORMATS: When we order our doormats, some come with slight imperfections such as dark spots, slight staining, small chipped corner or a small hole on the back of the mat not visible from the front of the doormat. If you are interested in a flawed doormat please send us a message and we will let you know if we have any in stock. If we do have any available, we will send you a photo of the doormat for you to approve before moving forward on the order. PLEASE NOTE, all flawed doormats are sold at a HUGE discounted price and all sales are FINAL. You are agreeing to the flaws during messaging and finalize the sale when you purchase the doormat.\nWe suggest replacing your doormat every few months as doormats tend to be a seasonal item. We are always adding more items so be sure to check back here for our new designs :)\nEach mat is unique. Some may be darker or lighter than the photo, coir is made from the husks of coconuts and some fibers might be thicker or thinner than others. There may also be chunks of the husks in the fibers.\nWe love CUSTOM ORDERS! Message us and let us know what you have in mind and we'll make it happen",

      "description": "These attractive slate sign designs are carefully designed to give your house number a modern, clean look.\n\nFirstly the slate is beveled and drilled in order to create a softer appearance around the edges and allow it to be attached to a wall.\n\nYour chosen number is then classically hand engraved with deep \"V\" cut lettering, not sandblasted or laser engraved like most other numbers. This gives an attractive depth to each number, allowing the number to stand out against the natural slate. Please note only Capital letters available in  \"V\" Cut.\n\nThe numbers are then given three layers of base paint, and a final layer of high gloss finish, this creates a brilliant white number. The slate is then waxed to bring out the natural colors of the slate and increase its durability and then finally it is carefully wrapped and packed.\n\nSize:\n2 digit numbers - 140mm x 100mm\n3 digit numbers - 200mm x 100mm\n4 digit numbers - 250mm x 100mm\n5 digit numbers - 250 to 300mm x 100mm\n\nExamples : 34, 34a, 56B, 78bis, 4567, 86543, 78i    (ie we can make anything)\n\nIf you request a number with lower case letters we will engrave the sign on our computer engraver which engraves flat digits/letters rather than the \"v\" cut.\n\n1&2 digit numbers will be dispatched Same Day\nOther numbers (3/4/5 digit) will be made and dispatched Next Day\n(all orders placed up to 3pm)\n\nLooking for something bigger? Check out our shop.\n\nPostage: Free UK ,  Europe \u00a38 (air mail), Rest of the world \u00a310 (air mail)\n\nHow to order:\nSimply select the correct option for your number from the drop down list.\nThen complete the personalization box with you required house number.\n(Numbers and letters can be accommodated   eg No 26A is classed as a 3-digit number)\nAny queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nGuarantee:\nIn the unlikely event you are at all unhappy with your purchase we offer to remake your number or give a full money back guarantee.",

      "description": "Welcome to Bell & the whistle.  We're a small woodshop in rural Arkansas, and we love making unique and special decorations for our customer.  We offer 4 stock sizes to choose from.  Please note that the height is measured from the top of the 'th' to the bottom of the 'g'.  The length is measured from the tips of the swashes on each side.  42\" x 11\",  36\" x 9.5\",  28\" x 7.25\",  22\" x 5.75\" HOW IT'S MADE:  Lettering is cut from 1/2\" birch plywood using a CNC router which creates a clean and consistent cut.  Each piece is sanded on front and back before being painted to your color choice. If you would like a distressed finish, we sand the paint to create this rustic look. To get this option, mention it in the Notes box at check-out.  WALLHANGING:  Our key hole hanging option is a ready-to-hang system and includes all the hardware you need for mounting to wood or.  Key hole slots are cut in the back of the word and screws are included. This hanging method is sturdy and invisible. All you will need is a Phillips-head screwdriver.  Select this option in the drop-down menu on the left before adding to your cart.  Our standard option does not include hanging hardware.  Some good methods for hanging are: Command Strips, glue, or small nails in the open spaces of the letters.  Because of the nature of the lettering, it is somewhat fragile and we recommend hanging it securely and out of reach of kids or pets.  LEAD TIME:  Each item is made to order. Our lead time is approximately 1-2 weeks after receiving payment. Items are shipped using USPS priority mail which arrives in 2-3 days. We cannot guarantee shipping times; these are just estimates.

The tapestry is a few inches shorter on both sides to allow room for tying the hanging string onto the ends of the stick.\n\nThe height or vertical length is measured form the wooden rod to the bottom of the yarn. The measurement does not include the string that the tapestry hangs from, which is an additional 6-9 inches.\n\nThe maker spends a lot of time browsing for unique and quality yarn. She loves to mix different textures and sizes to give some of the tapestries more depth and dimensions.\n\nShe views her tapestries as an art form!\n\nCustom orders are welcome. It gives the maker an opportunity to be creative and make something new! If you have a certain color scheme for a room, she can make it for you!\n\nHowever, please understand that yarn color is not like paint. The maker cannot mix it to create the perfect match to your dresser or bedspread. If you want \"harvest orange\" when the maker goes to the craft store there may only be three options of orange color of which \"harvest orange\" is not one of them. The maker will try to match them as close as possible.\n\nComputerized images of color schemes are more effective then photos taken with your phone because lighting can really alter the actual color.\n\nExpedited Shipping Information:\n\nIf you need your tapestry sooner then the allotted time required to make it, please purchase the \"Work on My Order Next and Expedite the Shipping\" listed in the shop for $40.\n\nCURRENT SHIPPING TIMES:\n\nThe expected delivery time is just an ESTIMATE. Please understand that USPS and the maker are working as fast as they can, but there may be some orders where the delivery time is a bit later than the listed expected date.\n\nThe maker is also a high school teacher and some weeks she is very busy volunteering and working late with students, parents or staff. She just wants to be as transparent as possible. She asks that you only place your order if you are willing to accept that depending on her work week, the package could be a bit later then expected.\n\nALL proceeds go to a miniature horse rescue and a kids summer camp where they learn to care for mini horses.\n\nReturns and exchanges:\n\nPlease be considerate about returns (for not only this shop but other Etsy shops as well). Keep in mind that the maker spends time shopping for material, prepping for your purchase, creating the product, packaging, and delivering for shipment. The maker is not Amazon, but an individual crafter. When you return something that means the maker pays out money for shipping and processing fees, plus hours of working on your order.\n\nThe maker will   most definitely accept a return however, the cost of shipping it back is the responsibility of the purchaser. Once the tapestry is returned, the maker will refund you for the price of the tapestry.",
